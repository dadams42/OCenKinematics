# Stellar kinematic data for Omega Centauri

Repository of stellar kinematic data for Omega Centauri self-consistently compiled and re-derived for various centers in (Bañares-Hernández et al. 24).

Description: Line-of-sight and proper motion velocity dispersions, including virial shape parameters and best-fit parameters for alpha-beta-gamma profiles using the 3 kinematic centers considered in (Bañares-Hernández et al. 24) for Omega Centauri's kinematics. Data are in GravSphere format and units, with distances in kpc and velocity dispersions in km/s at the assumed distance of 5.2 kpc. The "vel", "velpropR", "velproptan" txt files denote LOS and radial and tangential proper motion velocity dispersions (respectively). The "vsps" file includes the virial shape parameters with uper and lower 68 % CL errors (VSP1 and VSP2, respectively). The "p0best" includes the best-fit parameters used for the photometric alpha-beta-gamma profile.

Acknowledging this work: You are welcome to use these data for your own research, however, please consider the following: These data are based on multiple publicly available datasets that should be acknowledged. Please refer to Section 3 of (Bañares-Hernández et al. 24) for a detailed description of each of these studies and how these were compiled and modified in our study, acknowledging them accordingly depending on the data employed.
