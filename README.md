# Stellar kinematic data for Omega Centauri
Repository of stellar kinematic data of Omega Centauri used in (Bañares-Hernández et al. 24)

Description: Line-of-sight and proper motion velocity dispersions, including virial shape parameters and best-fit parameters for alpha-beta-gamma profiles using the 3 kinematic centers used in (Bañares-Hernández et al. 24) for Omega Centauri's kinematics. Data are in GravSphere format and units, with distances in kpc and dispersions in km/s at the assumed distance of 5.2 kpc. The "vel", "velpropR", "velproptan" txt files denote LOS and radial tangential proper motion velocity dispersions (respectively). The "vsps" file includes the virial shape parameters with uper and lower 68 % CL errors. The "p0best" includes the best-fit parameters used for the photometric alpha-beta-gamma profile.

Acknowledging this work: These data are based on multiple publicly available datasets that should be acknowledged. Please refer to Section 3 of (Bañares-Hernández et al. 24) for a detailed description of each of these studies and how these were compiled and modified in our study, acknowledging them accordingly depending on the data employed.
